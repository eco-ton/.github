# EcoTON

**EcoTON** is a zone of interaction between different ecosystems, where metabolism and energy take place. In the context of a space, this can mean the boundary between natural and artificial resources, between the urban and natural environment. 

**The Open Space** is a concept combining planning and ecosystem principles. It is a multi-layered space where housing, work, recreation and nature can coexist in harmony. The Open Space implies the creation of sustainable ecosystems in environment in which solutions are used to reduce the negative impact on nature.

### Concept

EcoTON of The Topen Space project is an initiative aimed at developing innovative solutions in the field of sustainable planning through the hackathon format. The purpose of the hackathon is to bring together specialists from different fields such as ecology, architecture, urbanism, engineering, social sciences, and creative thinking to work together on specific tasks.

### Cases

1. Ecology:
- The essence: The study of the relationships between organisms and the environment.
   - Awareness: Hackathon participants should study ecosystem processes and their importance for space. This includes understanding biomes, conserving biodiversity, and restoring natural resources.

2. Urbanism:
   - The essence: A scientific discipline dealing with the research and design of cities and their infrastructure.
   - Awareness: Participants must analyze urban structure, transportation, residential areas and social interactions in order to develop integrative solutions that do not disrupt the ecosystem.

3. Innovation:
   - The essence: The creation and implementation of new ideas, technologies and processes.

4. Technologies:
- The essence: The application of knowledge and tools to solve practical problems.
   - Awareness: Using Data Science, IoT, automation and other technologies to monitor and improve the environment. For example, the creation of "smart" waste management systems or energy consumption.

5. Social responsibility:
   - The essence: Understanding the importance of the social context and the impact of decisions on society.
   - Awareness: Participants should take into account the social aspects of their decisions, as ecosystem factors significantly affect the quality of life of citizens.
